# No Waste - Renewable Energy Solutions Website

# Personal Reflection
Honestly, this was my first real attempt at making a modern website from scratch. I picked renewable energy as the theme becuase I'm really passionate about environmental issues, and I wanted to create something that could actually make a difference. It was definitely challenging at times (especially getting that sticky navbar to work properly), but I learned so much during the process!

# Project Overview
This is a single-page website about renewable energy solutions. I tried to keep everything super clean and easy to navigate - no one likes a cluttered website, right? The whole idea was to make information about renewable energy accesible and actually interesting to read through.

# Design Philosophy
I took a lot of inspiration from Apple's website and spent way too much time looking at NextEra Energy's site. Main things I focused on:
- Big, beautiful images with those fancy overlay effects
- Smooth scrolling
- Clean, readable text that doesn't hurt your eyes

# Key Features
- Nav bar that follows you around
- Cool landing page with our branding
- Some key stats about renewable energy
- Detailed info about different energy types:
  - Wind Power
  - Solar Energy
  - Hydroelectric Power
- Contact form + social media links
